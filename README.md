# CountryMonitor
Android Basics Nanodegree Project 7

### Goal of the app
This app was part of my Android Basics Nanodegree at <a href="http://udacity.com">udacity.com</a>. The requirement was to create a news application which uses the Guardian's API to list news and provides the possibility to navigate to the original news on Guardian's website. The app has a preference to select the country on which you want to know the news and it also allows to filter news by categories if you click on the category labels.

Used technologies:
- HTTP requests
- JSON parsing
- AsyncTaskLoader
- Preferences
